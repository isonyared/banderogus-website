# Banderogus Website
Welcome to the Banderogus project! This website was created as part of a webinar conducted by GoIT School. The project showcases a creative concept centered around the fictional character Banderogus, a special "combat goose" symbolizing resilience and pride.

The GoIT School provided the images and creative assets for the project, ensuring a visually engaging design and a unique user experience.
